In the host:

1: Find the network interfaces used by docker - run the command:

    nmcli

and will show all network interfaces in the computer. The docker interfaces are: docker0 and br-xxxxxxxx (i think that depends on how many networks you have in the cluster)

For me, was 3 networks.

2- Add all interfaces to trusted zone with the command:

    firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --change-interface=docker0 --permanent
    firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --change-interface=brxxxxx --permanent
    firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --change-interface=bryyyyy --permanent

3- Reload the firewall with the command:

    firewall-cmd --reload

And will work :slight_smile:

If you want to test if the problem is the firewall or not you can disable the all the firewall with:

    systemctl disable firewalld

But you need to restart the host (centos8) after that!!! If you donâ€™t restar, will not work!!!
